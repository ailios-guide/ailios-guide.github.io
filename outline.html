	This is the second largest continent of Aiolios and the center of all <em>modern</em> industry in Ailios. The continent features mountainous regions to the North and East with temperate weather, vast forests with trees of red hue, snow-peaked mountains and ridges. To the north of the continent lies the <strong>Lion Ocean</strong> off the cold shores. This region is home to the <strong>Esoterran Empire</strong>. Their main cities include, <strong>Estergate (Capitol city), Fairport (main harbor hub for the empire), Woodsmark (largest industrial city). </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>	</strong>Off to the south the ridges falter into marshlands and the land is divided by many rivers providing transport to the <strong>Rai</strong> <strong>Ocean</strong> which lines the southern shores of Veryn.This land is made up of smaller settlements belonging to the <strong>Marinion Union</strong>. The citizens of the union have denounced the Esoterran Empire and live their lives according to their own rules and law. They have no shared economy or industry and all work for the betterment of the Union and the citizens of their settlement. Their major cities include <strong>Scarlet (Capitol City, large port settlement) </strong>and <strong>Trist Keep(Garrison City to protect the Union)</strong>
